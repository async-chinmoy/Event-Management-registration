# 🎉 Eventify – College Event Management Platform

**Eventify** is a full-stack web application designed to simplify how college events are managed, discovered, and attended. Whether you're a student looking to participate in hackathons or cultural fests, or an admin organizing workshops or sports meets, Eventify offers a streamlined experience for both ends.

Users can register and log in securely, browse various types of events across multiple categories, and get detailed information on each event. Admins have tools to create and manage events with ease, track participants, and monitor engagement. Events are displayed in an organized format with image galleries, ratings, and descriptions, enhancing user experience.

The site also includes features such as category-based browsing (e.g., Technical, Cultural, Sports, Literary, Management), real-time updates via state management, and toast notifications for instant feedback. Each event page provides full details—images, categories, prices (if any), and descriptions—making it easier for users to decide and register.

From onboarding to event participation, Eventify brings all the essential features together into one responsive, modern web platform. With performance-focused tools and technologies under the hood, it’s optimized for both speed and scalability.
